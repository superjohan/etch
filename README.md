A small iOS experiment. Got the idea after seeing some '50s abstract artwork on Tumblr. Should've probably made it with Processing instead. Honestly, I made this app so that I could make animated GIFs with it. Which, again, would've been easier with Processing. But animation is so easy with UIKit!

The app sets up a view on startup, which then starts animating until you quit the app. Modifications are easy to make. Just edit AEDEtchShapeView and/or AEDViewController. (I also regret the default prefix of the classes, and will probably change it at some point)

If you have some ideas on how to extend this lil' app, go ahead and do a pull request. Who knows, if it's snazzy enough, it could be submitted to the App Store.
